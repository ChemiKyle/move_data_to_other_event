# Move Data to Other Event

Allow priviliged users to move data between different events, including documents.

## Prerequisites
 - REDcap >= 9.3.0

## Easy installation
- Install the _Move Data to Other Event_ module from the Consortium [REDCap Repo] (https://redcap.vanderbilt.edu/consortium/modules/index.php) from the control center.

## Manual Installation
- Clone this repo into to `<redcap-root>/modules/move_data_to_other_event_v0.0.0`.

## Introduction
Once enabled, on the Record Home Page for any given record a series of icons will appear next to each filled in form and at the top of every event. These icons enable moving data for individual forms between events, or moving data within all forms on an event to another event, respectively.

## Global Configuration

Access may be limited to users with project design rights.

## Project Configuration

The module may be rendered active via checkbox (this has the same effect as disabling the module).
You may also allow non-designers to see and use the module on a per-project basis.
